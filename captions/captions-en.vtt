00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.520
hello my name is Brian day uh I was

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:07.640
struggling to think of something fun to

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.440
talk about for my video and I looked

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.160
over and I saw some cards that I

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.280
recently bought so I figured I'd talk

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.560
about those uh I'm a fan of the Pokemon

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.039
franchise I have been for years since I

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.279
was a little kid playing the video games

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.679
and uh collecting the cards one of my

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.359
recent interests that I found out there

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:31.359
are these cards that were only released

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:33.480
in Japan you can only get them in

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.879
vending machines and so these are some

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.440
examples of some of the

00:00:34.879 --> 00:00:38.920
Japanese Pokemon cards that I've started

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.440
collecting I think they're fun I put

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.920
them in a binder to look at something

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.520
fun about this one this guy's name is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.360
Kadabra and he was based off of a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.760
magician named Yuri Geller who in 2002

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.760
sued the Pokemon company because they

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:57.920
used his uh shtick for this Pokemon and

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.600
he was never printed on a Pokemon card

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.519
ever since then but they recently just

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.280
set

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.280
so he'll be getting printed again
